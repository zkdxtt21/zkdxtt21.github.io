# Reading Notes
## Idea
A major limitation of current GNN architectures is that they are inherently flat as they only propagate information across the edges of the graph and are unable to infer and aggregate the
information in a hierarchical way. 

DIFFPOOL allows for developing deeper GNN models that can learn to operate on hierarchical representations of a graph.

## Results
They show that DIFFPOOL can be combined with various GNN approaches, resulting in an average 7% gain in accuracy and a new state of the art on four out of five benchmark graph classification tasks.

## Model Structure
![](images/DiffPool-Structure.png)

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are used as the basic layers for Diffpool.  
They use an assignment matrix in their model.

Aggregate information for different clusters, and compute the connection matrix for the new clusters.
